## Profile

I’m a mechanical engineer specializing in product and system design, with a strong foundation in structural analysis, manufacturing, and prototyping. My work spans from automotive components and consumer products to technical process improvements. I enjoy solving complex problems through design, and turning concepts into things you can actually build.

I bring a multidisciplinary mindset, practical design sense, and a track record of taking projects from sketch to shop floor. I’ve worked in engineering teams, international environments, and cross-functional collaborations. I also happen to enjoy good CAD models, clean technical drawings, and making design decisions based on real-world constraints.

## More About Me

I’m passionate about good design, clean interfaces (both human and mechanical), and how things are made. I thrive on learning new tools and solving problems at the intersection of creativity and precision. Whether it's a consumer product or a mechanical system, I care about how things look, feel, and function.

If you're interested in colaborating on a project, discussing design, or just want to chat about engineering, feel free to [contact me](contact.md)! I’m always up for a good conversation about how to make things better, faster, and more fun to build!
