I'm a mechanical design engineer who believes good design should be as smart as it is functional, and ideally, fun to build. With a background in structural analysis, product development, and international collaboration, I turn complex problems into manufacturable solutions.

From safety-critical automotive systems to production workflows, I design with both precision and purpose. I specialize in CAD, prototyping, and getting things to actually work, whether that's on a racetrack, in a factory, or on a 3D printer at 2 a.m.

This is where I keep my CV and design portfolio. Take a look around!
Or, by all means, <a href="contact.html">reach out</a> if you have an idea worth building!
